     <p>In the previous lesson, you learned about encapsulation and information hiding. All of that functionality is possible because of a 
         feature of JavaScript: <i>closures</i>. Closures appear to be relatively straightforward, yet they 
         can be really difficult to wrap your head around. 
         This entire lesson is devoted to closures: what they are, how they work, 
         and when to use them.

      <p>We've mentioned closures before, now it's time to uncover the mystery that surrounds them. We'll start with some 
          basic examples and then come back to a couple of examples from the previous lessons to see how we've used closures 
          in the past.</p>

      <p><img src="save.png"> Save this in your <b>/AdvJS</b> folder as <b>closure.html</b>, and <img src="preview(1).png">.
          Open the console (reload the file if necessary) and you'll see, "Result is: 5." </p>
         
      <p>In this code we've got a function that returns another function. You may remember from an 
          <a href="https://students.oreillyschool.com/coursecontent/advancedjavascript/Functions.html#returning_a_function_from_a_function" target="_blank">earlier lesson</a>  
          that functions are <i>first-class values</i>; that is, you can return a function from a function, just like you can return values 
          like 3 or "string." The function <b>makeAdder()</b> returns a function, <b>adder()</b>, that adds two values and 
          returns the result. We've named the function <b>adder()</b> inside <b>makeAdder()</b>, but when we return it from 
          <b>makeAdder()</b>, we name it <b>f()</b>. So, in order to call the returned function, we use <b>f()</b>. (We could use the same 
          name for the function in both places, but for this lesson we want to have a way to identify the function when it's <i>defined</i>, 
          and the function when it's <i>called</i>.)</p>
         
      <p>The two values that we want to add together are passed to the <b>madeAdder()</b> function as arguments when we 
          call it. The function <b>adder()</b> doesn't take any arguments. Instead, <b>adder()</b> adds together the two numbers passed into 
          <b>makeAdder()</b>. So, how does this work? </p>
         
      <p>Local variables (including parameters of functions) disappear after the function within which they are defined is done 
          executing. So, while the parameters <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are defined when the function <b>adder()</b> is <i>created</i>, when we 
          <i>call</i> it later, using the name <b>f()</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are long gone. So how does calling <b>f()</b> return 
          the (correct) value, 5? It's seems like <b>f()</b> somehow "remembers" the values of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> which were defined when 
          <b>f()</b> was created (as <b>adder()</b>). </p>
         
      <p>Well, that's exactly what happens. The function <b>f()</b> "remembers" the values of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> through a closure. Let's 
          step through the execution of this code to see the closure in the JavaScript console.</p>
         
      <p>First, open the file <b>closure.html</b> in the Chrome browser, and add a breakpoint to the line of code where we call 
          <b>makeAdder()</b>:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure1.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Add a breakpoint, click the <b>Sources</b> tab, and then open <b>closure.html</b> (from the left pane). Click on the 
          line number next to the line of code where you want to add the breakpoint (in our version, that's line number 16). The 
          breakpoint appears under the <b>Breakpoints</b> section in the right pane. </p>
          
         
      <p>Now, reload the page and click the <b>Step into</b> button twice. This is the third button from the left of the right pane, with a 
          little arrow pointing down on top of a period:</p>
             

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure2.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>We're now on the line where we return <b>adder()</b>. Look in the right pane under <b>Scope Variables</b>. The local 
          variables that are defined inside <b>makeAdder()</b>, including the two parameters, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, as well as the 
          <b>adder()</b> function. These are all local variables because they are defined within <b>makeAdder()</b>.</p>
         
      <p>Click <b>Step into</b> twice more; we're now stopped on the line where we call <b>f()</b> (we haven't executed this line yet). 
          <b>f</b> is a global variable (if you open <b>Global</b> under Scope Variables in the right pane, you'll see it defined as a 
          global variable, which is the global window object). </p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure3.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Click <b>Step into</b> once more, so that we call <b>f()</b> and stop just before we return the result of adding <b>x</b> and 
          <b>y</b>:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure4.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Under Scope Variables, in Local, you see something called <b>Closure</b>. Inside that, you'll see two variables: <b>x</b> and 
          <b>y</b>, with their values set correctly to 2 and 3â€”the arguments we passed into <b>makeAdder()</b> earlier. This is the 
          closure, where <b>f()</b> gets its two values to add together.</p>
          
         
      <p><b>Step into</b> twice again to execute the line of code, <b>return x + y</b>, and return from <b>f()</b>. The closure disappears:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure5.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Click <b>Resume script execution</b> to complete the script execution.</p>

  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">What is a Closure?</div><div class="subheadingText">
         
      <p>Now you've <i>made</i> a closure, but what exactly <i>is</i> a closure? </p> 
         
      <p>To understand a closure, you need to remember how <i>scope</i> works. In the <a href="https://students.oreillyschool.com/coursecontent/advancedjavascript/Scope.html#scope_chains" target="_blank">earlier lesson on scope</a>, 
           we talked about how the <i>scope chain</i> is created when you call functions.
          The scope chain is a series of scope objects containing the values of the variables in a function's scope. For global functions 
          (that is, functions defined at the top level), we have just two scope levels: the local scope (the scope within the function) and 
          the global scope. When you call a function and refer to a variable, we get the value for that variable first by looking in the 
          local scope and, if we can't find it there, we look in the global scope.</p>
         
      <p>Now, recall that when we call a nested (or "inner") function, we have three scope levels: the scope of the nested function, then the 
          scope of the function containing the nested function, and finally the global scope. </p>
         
      <p>In our example, we created a nested function named <span class="darkgreen">adder()</span>: </p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="darkred">function makeAdder(x, y) {
    <span class="darkgreen">var adder = function() {
        return x + y;
    };</span>

    <span class="darkblue">return adder</span>;
}</span>

var f = makeAdder(2, 3);
var result = f();
console.log("Result is: " + result);             
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p>Inside <span class="darkgreen">adder()</span>, we refer to two variables, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. These variables are defined in the 
          <span class="darkred">makeAdder()</span> function, so they are <i>not</i> local to <b>adder()</b>. If we just called 
          <span class="darkgreen">adder()</span> from inside <span class="darkred">makeAdder()</span> (for example, if we changed the line 
          <span class="darkblue">return adder</span> to <b>adder()</b>), you'd see that in order to figure out the values of the variables <b>x</b> 
          and <b>y</b>, we'd use the scope chain. We'd look for those values in the scope of <span class="darkgreen">adder()</span> first, but we wouldn't 
          find them there so we'd look for those values in the scope of <span class="darkred">makeAdder()</span>, and we'd find them there.</p>
         
      <p>However, we're not calling <b>adder()</b> from inside <b>makeAdder()</b>; we're <i>returning</i> <b>adder()</b> 
          from <b>makeAdder()</b>. 
          When we return the <b>adder()</b> function, it comes along with a scope object: an object that contains the variables that are in 
          the scope of <b>adder()</b> when <b>adder()</b> is created. That includes the two variables <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. This object is 
          essentially the same as the <i>scope object</i> of <b>makeAdder()</b> that was created for the scope chain. It's the 
          <i>context</i> within which <b>adder()</b> is created. </p>
         
      <p>This object is the closure. A closure is an object that captures the context in place when a function is created. The closure 
          "remembers" all the variables that are in scope at the time the inner function is created. If we just call the inner function right 
          away, the closure gets thrown away when the containing function ends, but if we <i>return</i> that inner function, the closure 
          comes along with it: </p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="ClosureDiagram1.jpg" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>When we <i>call</i> that function later and look for the values of the variables it refers to, if we don't find those values in 
          the function itself (that is, they aren't local variables), we look in the closure: </p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="ClosureDiagram2.jpg" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>So the closure becomes part of the scope chain when you call a function.</p>
         
      <p>The closure looks a lot like the scope object that's added to the chain when we call a nested function from its 
          containing function (for example, if we called <b>adder()</b> from inside <b>makeAdder()</b>). Although here, we use the closure 
          instead of the scope object because we're calling the returned function (<b>f()</b>) <i>after</i> the containing function has 
          returned, so we can't use the normal scope chain to find the values of the variables in <b>f()</b>; we have to use the closure 
          instead. We've "captured" the scope, or context, within which the nested function was created in the closure so we can refer to 
          the variables long after the containing function has completed execution. </p>

      <p>Let's play with closures a bit so you can see how they work. First, let's prove that only variables that are actually 
          referenced by an inner function are added to a closure. Modify <b>closures.html</b> as shown:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt; Closures &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;script&gt; 
        
    function makeAdder(x, y) {
        <ins>var z = 10;</ins> 
        var adder = function() {
            return x + y;
        };

        return adder;
    }

    var f = makeAdder(2, 3);
    var result = f();
    console.log("Result is: " + result);
    
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;        
</pre></div></div>
      
      <p><img src="save.png"> and <img src="preview(1).png">. In the console, open the <b>Sources</b> tab, and look at 
          <b>closure.html</b>. Clear the previous breakpoint and add a breakpoint to the line where we return the result of adding <b>x</b> 
          and <b>y</b> (inside <b>adder()</b>), like this:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure6.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Reload the page. The execution will stop at the breakpoint, so you can inspect the closure. Notice that even though we've added a 
          local variable <b>z</b> to <b>makeAdder()</b>, that variable is not included in the closure. Why? Because it's not referenced by 
          <b>adder()</b>, so it's not needed in the closure.</p>
         
      <p>Next, let's prove that only non-local variables are added to a closure:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;script&gt; 
        
    function makeAdder(x, y) {
        var z = 10;
        var adder = function() {
            <ins>var x = 10;</ins>
            return x + y;
        };

        return adder;
    }

    var f = makeAdder(2, 3);
    var result = f();
    console.log("Result is: " + result);
    
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;        
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p><img src="save.png"> and <img src="preview(1).png"> preview. In the console, open the <b>Sources</b> tab, and 
          look at 
          <b>closure.html</b>:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure6b.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div> <p></p>
         
      <p>Now, only <b>y</b> is in the closure. The local variable <b>x</b> <i>shadows</i> the parameter <b>x</b> in <b>makeAdder()</b>, so 
          <b>x</b> is no longer needed in the closureâ€”we'll always use the value of the local variable if we refer to <b>x</b> in 
          <b>adder()</b>. Also, look at the console (click on the <b>Console</b> tab); the result is now 13 instead of 5.</p>

          <b>Resume script execution</b> again. Now when execution stops at the breakpoint, we call <b>g()</b>, so you'll see the

      <p>In other words, <b>f()</b> and <b>g()</b> get separate closures containing different values for <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. You can call 
          <b>f()</b> again after calling <b>g()</b>, and you'll still get the right answer. When <b>f()</b> and <b>g()</b> are created, the values of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are

           so each function has a separate closure, each with different values for the
          variables that are in it. Remember, a closure captures the context of a function when that function is <i>created</i>.</p>

      <p><img src="save.png"> and <img src="preview(1).png">. Look at the result in the console. The result of calling 
          <b>f()</b> is now 13, and the result of calling <b>g()</b> is now 15. If you still have the breakpoint at line 10, 
          you'll see that the closure now contains the value 10 for <b>x</b> in both functions.
         
      That's because a closure is a <i>reference to an object</i>: an object that contains the values of the variables in the scope of the 
          function associated with the closure. So, when we call <b>makeAdder()</b> the first time, we create 
          the function <b>adder()</b> by defining it in <b>makeAdder()</b>. The closure is created, and <b>adder()</b> gets a reference to 
          that closure object, which contains a property named <b>x</b> with the value 2 (the value we passed into <b>makeAdder()</b>).  
          Before we return the <b>adder()</b> function value, we change the value of the property in the closure object associated with 
          <b>adder()</b>. <b>adder()</b> still points to the same closure object, but we've <i>changed</i> the value in that closure object, 
          so later, when we call <b>f()</b> (which is just another name for the <b>adder()</b> function we created when we called 
          <b>makeAdder(2, 3)</b>), we look up the value of <b>x</b> and find 10 instead of 2:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="ClosureDiagram3.jpg" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>This is really important to understand, so look it over a couple of times. If you don't remember that 
          the closure associated with a function is an object, and so what's stored in the function object as the closure is actually a 
          <i>reference to an object</i>, you could run into problems. If you change that object <i>after</i> you've created the function, 
          that function will use the 
          <i>new</i> values in the object, not the original ones.</p>

  <a name="s_07"></a><div id="s_07"><div class="subheading">Using Closures</div><div class="subheadingText">
         
      <p>Now you know how closures work, so when are they useful. After all, it's not often that we create 
          functions that return other functions in our everyday code. Let's look at a few examples of where closures come in handy.</p>
         
   <h5>Using Closures to Create Private Data</h5>
         
      <p>We'll start by creating a function that counts. Create a new file and add this code:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt; Counter &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;script&gt; 
        
    function makeCounter() {
        var count = 0;
        return function() {
            count = count + 1;
            return count;
        };
    }

    var count = makeCounter();
    console.log("Counter: " + count());
    console.log("Counter: " + count());
    console.log("Counter: " + count());
    console.log("Counter: " + count());
    console.log("Counter: " + count());
    
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</ins>         
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p><img src="save.png"> Save this in your <b>/AdvJS</b> folder as <b>counter.html</b>, and <img src="preview(1).png">.
          Open the console (and reload the file if necessary) and you see: </p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>Counter: 1 
Counter: 2 
Counter: 3 
Counter: 4 
Counter: 5</pre></div></div>
      
      <p>This is kind of cool because we've used a closure to encapsulate the counter variable, and the process of counting. In other words, 
          the counter variable, <b>count</b>, is totally private, and the only way to increment it is to call the function <b>count()</b>. 
          The <b>count</b> variable exists only within the closure for the function <b>count()</b>, so no one can come along and change the 
          value of the counter by doing anything other than calling <b>count()</b>.</p>
         
   <h5>Closures as Click Handlers</h5>
         
      <p>So far we've looked at examples that return a function from a function, and seen how the function that is returned comes 
          along with a closure object. Another way to use a function after the context within which the function is created has gone away is 
          to assign a function to an object property; for instance, like when we assign handlers for events to a property in an object, like a 
          &lt;div&gt;. Create a new file to look at a common use of closuresâ€”and a common mistake that goes along with it:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt; Closures for divs &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    div {
        position: relative;
        margin: 10px;
        background-color: red;
        border: 1px solid black;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    window.onload = function() {
        var numDivs = 3;
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; numDivs; i++) {
            var div = document.getElementById("div" + i);
            div.onclick = function() {
                console.log("You just clicked on div number " + i);
            };
        }
    };
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="div0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="div1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="div2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</ins>         
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p><img src="save.png"> Save this in your <b>/AdvJS</b> folder as <b>divsClosure.html</b> and <img src="preview(1).png">.
          You see three red squares. Open the console and try clicking on each of the squares. Each time you do, you'll see "You just clicked 
          on div number 3." Can you figure out why we get "3" each time, instead of the correct value for each &lt;div&gt; (that is, 0, 1 or 
          2)? Think about it for a few minutes before you go on.</p>
         
      <p>First, we've got three different &lt;div&gt;s in the page, with the ids "div0," "div1," and "div2." We want to add a click handler to
          each &lt;div&gt;. Each click handler will do the same thing: display a message showing the number corresponding to the number in the 
          id of the &lt;div&gt;. So if you click on the "div0" &lt;div&gt;, you'll see the message, "You just clicked on div number 0," and 
          likewise for &lt;div&gt;s 1 and 2.</p>
         
      <p>So, in the code, we create a for loop to iterate through the three &lt;div&gt;s and add a click handler to each. We use the loop 
          variable <b>i</b> for the number of the &lt;div&gt; so we can display that number in the click handler. Notice that the 
          <span class="darkred">click handler function</span> that we assign to each of the &lt;div&gt; objects references the variable 
          <span class="orange">i</span>, and <span class="orange">i</span> is not defined in the <span class="darkred">click handler function</span>â€”it's defined in the 
          scope surrounding the <span class="darkred">click handler function</span> (that is, in the <b>window.onload</b> function).</p>
         
      <p>So what happens? A closure is created! When we store the function value of the <span class="darkred">click handler function</span> in the 
          <b>onclick</b> property, that function comes along with a closure that contains the variable <span class="orange">i</span>. Later, when you 
          click on the &lt;div&gt;, the value of <span class="orange">i</span> will be found in the closure associated with the 
          <span class="darkred">click handler function</span>.</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>window.onload = function() {
    var numDivs = 3;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numDivs; i++) {
        var div = document.getElementById("div" + i);
        div.onclick = <span class="darkred">function() {
             console.log("You just clicked on div number " + <span class="orange">i</span>);
        };</span>
    }
};          
</pre></div></div>
      
      <p>That all sounds good, but it's not working right. We see 3 every time we click on any of the &lt;div&gt;s instead of the 
          correct number for the &lt;div&gt;. Why? </p>
         
      <p>Well, remember, a closure associated with a function is an object, and the function contains a 
          <i>reference</i> to that closure object. So if we change the value of a variable that's captured in the closure <i>after</i> 
          we create that closure, we're changing the value of the variable that will be used when we call that function later.</p>
         
      <p>In this example, each time we set the <span class="darkred">click handler function</span> to the <b>onclick</b> property of a &lt;div&gt;, 
          the value of <span class="orange">i</span> will be correct initially, but then we change the value of <span class="orange">i</span> the next time through 
          the loop, which changes the value in the closure we just made.</p>
         
      <p>Our loop stops iterating when the value of <b>i</b> is 3. So when we call any of those click handler functions later (like when 
          you click on a &lt;div&gt;), you see the value of <b>i</b> that was in place at the end of the loop, <i>not</i> the value of 
          <b>i</b> that was in place when the closure was created originally. </p>
         
      <p>Try using the console to add a breakpoint in the code to inspect the closure. Add the breakpoint on the line in the click handler 
          function where we use <b>console.log()</b> to display the &lt;div&gt; information. Click on a &lt;div&gt; to see the closure when 
          the click handler function is called.</p>
         
      <p>We can fix this by creating another closure. Let's see how:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>...
window.onload = function() {
    var numDivs = 3;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numDivs; i++) {
        var div = document.getElementById("div" + i);
        <del>div.onclick = function() {
            console.log("You just clicked on div number " + i);
        };</del>
        <ins>div.onclick = (function(divNum) {
            return function() {
                console.log("You just clicked on div number " + divNum);
            };
        })(i);</ins>
    }
};             
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p><img src="save.png"> and <img src="preview(1).png">. Try clicking on each &lt;div&gt; again. Now you get 
          the correct number 
          values for each &lt;div&gt;.</p>
         
      <p>How does this work?</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>window.onload = function() {
    var numDivs = 3;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numDivs; i++) {
        var div = document.getElementById("div" + i);
        div.onclick = <span class="darkgreen">(function(<span class="orange">divNum</span>) {
            return <span class="darkred">function() {
                console.log("You just clicked on div number " + <span class="orange">divNum</span>);
            };</span>
        })(<span class="teal">i</span>);</span>
    }
};             
</pre></div></div>
         
      <p>When we assign the value of each &lt;div&gt;'s <span class="darkred">click handler function</span>, we do so by executing 
          <span class="darkgreen">another function</span> that returns a function value for the <span class="darkred">click handler</span>. 
          <span class="darkgreen">This function</span> executes right away. It seem a little odd because we're putting the function 
          expression in parentheses first, and after the function expression, we have another set of parentheses: </p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>div.onclick = <span class="darkgreen">(function(<span class="orange">divNum</span>) { ... })  (<span class="teal">i</span>);</span>           
</pre></div></div>
      
      <p>We're <i>calling</i> the <span class="darkgreen">function we just created</span>. (We'll talk more about this 
          pattern of creating and calling a function in one step in a later lesson).</p>
         
      <p>Putting the function expression in parentheses makes sure the function expression is treated as an expression, and not a 
          function declaration. Also, we pass the value of <span class="teal">i</span> into the <span class="darkgreen">function we're calling</span>. The 
          value gets passed into a variable <span class="orange">divNum</span>, which is used by <span class="darkred">a function</span> we're returning from the 
          <span class="darkgreen">function we just called</span>. When we return <span class="darkred">a function</span> from <span class="darkgreen">a function</span>, 
          we create a closure that contains any variables referenced by the <span class="darkred">the function being returned</span> that are defined 
          in the <span class="darkgreen">function that contains it</span>. In this case, both of these functions are anonymous; we're not actually giving 
          them names like we did before with <b>makeAdder()</b> and <b>adder()</b>, but that's okay. The closure works in exactly the same 
          way. In this case, the closure associated with the <span class="darkred">the function being returned</span> contains the value of 
          <span class="orange">divNum</span>. Note that this value <i>does not change</i>. Even if the value of <span class="teal">i</span> changes,  
          the value of <span class="orange">divNum</span> in the closure does not (remember that arguments are passed by value to functions, so 
          <span class="orange">divNum</span> gets a <i>copy</i> of the value in <span class="teal">i</span>).</p>
         
      <p>The <span class="darkred">function that's returned</span> is assigned to the <b>div.onclick</b> property, so it is available once the 
          <b>window.onload</b> function has completed. That means that the values in that function's closure are also available, so when you 
          click on a &lt;div&gt;, you'll get the correct number for that &lt;div&gt; because you're accessing the 
          <span class="orange">divNum</span> variable in the closure. Add a breakpoint to the code on the <b>console.log()</b> line again (line 23
          in our version), and inspect the closure when you click on a &lt;div&gt;. You'll see the variable <b>divNum</b> and the correct 
          number for the &lt;div&gt; you clicked on:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure11.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
         
      <p>Using a closure like this to capture the current value of a variable by passing it to a function that returns another function is a 
          common technique used by JavaScript programmers (and one we'll look at more in the next lesson).</p>

          <b>makeConverterFunction</b> references the two parameters: <b>multiplier</b> and <b>term</b>. When we call the 
          returned function later (as <b>kilometersToMiles()</b> or as <b>milesToKilometers()</b>), we'll use the closures 
          associated with the 
          two functions that captured the contextâ€”the values of the parameters when the function was defined and returnedâ€”to 
          determine the values of those variables.</p>
         
      <p>Try adding a breakpoint inside the function that's returned (within <b>makeConverterFunction</b>) so you can see the closures in 
          action.</p>
         
      <p>Let's also look again at the <b>squaresAPI.html</b> example from the <a href="https://students.oreillyschool.com/coursecontent/advancedjavascript/EncapsulationAndAPIS.html#an_example" target="_blank">Encapsulation and APIs lesson</a>. In that lesson we talked about encapsluation and information hiding. We used a 
          constructor, <b>Square()</b>, to create objects, but kept some of the data in the object being created private by not assigning 
          values to properties of the object. Instead we used local variables and nested functions. (Again, if you no longer have the file 
          <b>squaresAPI.html</b> in your <b>AdvJS/</b> folder, feel free to copy it in from here and save it as <b>AdvJS/squares.html</b>.)</p>

      <p>The closure created by the <b>Square()</b> constructor is a little less obvious, but it's there. In <b>this.grow()</b>, 
          we refer to two nested functions, <b>setBigger()</b> and <b>setColor()</b>. Both are nested functions which means they are 
          <i>local</i> variables in the <b>Square()</b> constructor. Just like any other kind of local variable, like <b>initialSize</b> 
          or <b>id</b>, the values of these functions will disappear once <b>Square()</b> completes executing.</p>
         
      <p>Because we reference these functions in <b>this.grow()</b>, the functions are added to the closure for the <b>this.grow()</b> 
          method. In addition, any local variables that are in scope for these two functions are also added to the closure. Why? Because those 
          values might be needed when we call <b>square1.grow()</b> and <b>square2.grow()</b>, otherwise, we'd get a reference error. So both 
          of the function values that are used directly by <b>this.grow()</b>, as well as any other variables in scope for those two functions, 
          are added to the closure. You can inspect the closure by adding a breakpoint to one of the lines of code in <b>this.grow()</b>. 
          When you click the <b>Grow</b> button to call the <b>this.grow()</b> method of the square, you'll hit the breakpoint, and you'll be 
          able to see the closure:</p>
         
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="Closure10.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
      
  </div></div>

 </div>

    <p>Whenever you create a function that references variables from the surrounding context, a closure is created. If you return that 
        function from a function, or assign it to an object property, so the function is available outside of the context within which it was 
        created, the closure comes along with the function. This means the function can "remember" the values of the variables it references. 
        This is where the closure gets its name: a closure "closes" over the variables in scope when the function is created so it can keep 
        them available for the function later, after the original context disappears. Think of closures as functions plus scope. 
        If you understand scope, you'll understand closures too.</p> 
    
    <p>Note that closures aren't necessary for global variables, because global variables have global scope. They are available 
        everywhere in your code, so there's no need to "remember" them in a closure.</p>
    
    <p>The primary use for closures is to create private data, like we did with the counter example and with the squares example. You'll see 
        closures used this way frequently (for example, in libraries like jQuery and Backbone.js).</p>
    
    <p>Closures are notoriously tricky to wrap your head around, so take some extra time to review the lesson again and make sure you've got 
        it. Use the Chrome console to inspect the closures you create to help you understand what's going on.</p>
